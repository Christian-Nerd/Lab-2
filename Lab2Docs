PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A widget is on sale. Given the retail price and the discount rate, what is the sale price? What is the total price of the item once the sales tax is added?

Step 1. Find the Sales Tax and store that as a constant

Step 2. Make the user input wholesale price, mark up rate(as percentage not decimal), discount rate(as percentage not decimal) store each in a variable 

Step 3. wholesale price + (wholesale price * mark up rate/100) - (whole sale price * discount rate/100) = sale price

Step 4 sale price + (sale price * NY Sales tax) = total price

Step 5: Output total price
